### **0:00 - 0:08 | The Hook**
**Visual:**  
*Start at the very top of the site. Slow scroll begins. The "Devansh Singh Rajput" text fades in over the dark, moody background.*

**Audio:**  
"In a world of noise, true design speaks in silence."

---

### **0:08 - 0:18 | The Experience**
**Visual:**  
*Smoothly scroll down. Show the image sequence animating fluently (the scrollytelling effect). Pause briefly on the "Cultivating peace" text overlays.*

**Audio:**  
"This isn't just a website. It’s a 500-viewport-height journey ... blending WebGL performance with organic philosophy."

---

### **0:18 - 0:26 | The Code**
**Visual:**  
*Cut to VS Code. Brief flashes of:*
1. *`ScrollyCanvas.tsx` (showing the canvas logic).*
2. *`Overlay.tsx` (clean Framer Motion animations).*

**Audio:**  
"Powered by Next.js and pure Canvas. 128 frames rendered seamlessly... with zero compromise on speed."

---

### **0:26 - 0:30 | The Conclusion**
**Visual:**  
*Cut back to the final "Contact" section on the site. Fade to black.*

**Audio:**  
"Devansh Singh Rajput. Where code meets consciousness."
